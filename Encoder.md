CinematicVR Panner embeds plenty of encoders. Encoders are the end point of any CinematicVR project. Once everything is ready and saved (needed for encoding) you will be able to export your project using encoders

This can be done by clicking on this icon :
![img export][tuto_audio_file_source_check_encode]

Then, a new window will show up with different parameters.

![img encoder][tuto_encoder]

## AspicEncoder

AspicEncoder is our own encoder and can be used to replay projects using the CinematicVR [player][player]. Two files will be generated by using this encoder. An .asatl file which is the default file extension of CinematicVR projects, and an ogg file sound.

## ADM

The Audio Definition Model is an ITU specification of metadata that can be used to describe object-based audio, scene-based audio and channel-based audio. It can be included in BWF WAVE files or used as a streaming format in production environments. In the CinematicVR purpose, we inject ADM´s metadatas into the generated wav file.

CinematicVR generate EBU ADM specification. This specification has few differences with ITU´s specification.
This specific file can be read by players handling ADM specification such as the [IRCAM ADM´s player](http://forumnet.ircam.fr/product/spat-en/admix-en/).
