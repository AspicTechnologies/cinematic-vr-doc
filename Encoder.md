CinematicVR Panner embeds a growing list of encoders. Encoders are the end point of any CinematicVR project. Once everything is ready and saved (needed for encoding) you will be able to export your project using encoders. The ability to use encoders at this step is directly obtained thanks to the Object based audio approach.

To access the available encoders, you must first check that there exists a File audio source in your project, as encoding is only available for this type of source. 

The encoder window can be accessed by clicking on this icon :
![img export][tuto_audio_file_source_check_encode]

Then, a new window will show up with different parameters according to the currently selected encoders.

## AspicEncoder

AspicEncoder is our own encoder and can be used to replay projects using the CinematicVR [player][player]. Two files will be generated by using this encoder. An .asatl file which is the default file extension of CinematicVR projects, and an .ogg file sound.
The .asatl file, contains metadata concerning the attached .ogg file (objects position, mix focus values, etc.). Keyframes are also added so that a linear interpolation between positions will place objects correctly (spherical interpolation is used internally).

As the CinematicVR player can handle both objects and ambisonics, the generated .ogg file will contain both types.
- one track by objects rendered as Object,
- 4, 9 or 16 tracks for ambisonics, regrouping objects rendered as Ambisonics and ambisonics stream,
- 2 tracks for the Head Locked Binaural stream.
If the number of tracks is 6, an empty track is added to avoid the confusion with 5.1 contents.

The .asatl file is a text based representation that is imported by a Unity based [player][player].

## Facebook

Two Big Ears and then Facebook have introduced there own format, that can be both integrated in a video container or read as a separated .tbe file. When producing for Facebook, the encoder provided within the Facebook Spatial Audio Workstation is used. It uses a 8 tracks audio file for spatial content and a 2 tracks for head locked contents.

The Cinematic VR encoder for Facebook is able to produce both file from your project. All objects, and ambisonics stream will be stored in a 8 channels spatial audio file, whereas headlocked content will be mixed into a 2 channels file.

Both file can then be used in the Facebook encoder to create a .tbe file or to be integrated in a video container.

Warning : Runtime driven effects such as MixFocus are lost with this encoder.

## Ambix 

The Ambix representation is a standard way to represent ambisonics stream (ordering ACN with SN3D normalization). The Ambix encoder provided with Cinematic VR is able to encode your project to a ambix .wav file. An option is available to choose the destination ambisonics order.

All objects are encoded at this given order and mixed with other ambisonics streams.

Headlocked stereo content are mixed in a second file. A future evolution will propose to encode this headlocked component in the ambisonics stream as an omnidirectional content.

Warning : Runtime driven effects such as MixFocus are lost with this encoder.

## ADM

The Audio Definition Model is an ITU specification of metadata that can be used to describe object-based audio, scene-based audio and channel-based audio. It can be included in BWF WAVE files or used as a streaming format in production environments. In the CinematicVR purpose, we inject ADM´s metadatas into the generated wav file.

CinematicVR generates EBU ADM specification. This specification has few differences with ITU´s specification.
This specific file can be read by players handling ADM specification such as the [IRCAM ADM´s player](http://forumnet.ircam.fr/product/spat-en/admix-en/).

Warning : Runtime driven effects such as MixFocus are lost with this encoder.
