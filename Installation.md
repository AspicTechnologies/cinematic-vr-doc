## Troubleshooting

### Windows Smart Screen has protected me, what does that mean?
CinematicVR is a new software and not widely spread yet. Therefore, it is possible that Microsoft security policy may prevent you from installing CinematicVR. If you meet this system, called Smart Screen, you can tell him that you don't want to be protected just this time, and keep on with our installation process. 

### Why is install button disabled?
Install button will be available if you own a license, valid or not. If the button is disabled, please ask for a trial, or contact us to purchase a license.

### Why is launch button disabled?
Please install CinematicVR. This button will launch the latest CinematicVR that was successfully installed on your computer.

### I cannot see any license in the "Your licenses" area
Either you don't own a license or you are not connected to your account. 

If you dont own a license, please ask for a trial or contact us directly. If you are not connected, you can use the password you received by email, or ask for a new password, using "Forgot your password?" in Login tab.

### It seems that my license is invalid

Trial licenses are valid for a period of 30 days. This period begins the day you attach the license to your computer. If your license is invalid:
